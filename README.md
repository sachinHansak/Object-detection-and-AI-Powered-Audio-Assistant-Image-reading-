# Object-detection-and-AI-Powered-Audio-Assistant(Image-reading)
Here i have developed the Object detection application using "facebook/detr-resnet-50" model and after that conversion it will create the objects summary into text of the image and then that text feeds into the text-to-speech model and get the output as audio.
